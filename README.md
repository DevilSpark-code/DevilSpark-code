# Think, Forget, Do.

There are usually many things that people tell about themselves. But I like to get straight to the point.

### What I like. 
- A nice cup of warm coffee â˜•
- Anime ðŸ’–
- Videogames, and music that may be forbidden in 11 states. 

### What I prefer. 
- When people know how to communicate. 
- A clear deal 
- And a nice chair. 

### What I know. 
Basically nothing, But boy I know a lot about being comfy.
Ah, and ppl say IÂ´m a fast learner (If that means something) I can learn any language and forget what I learned the next day, but I like to do code. 

P.D: TambiÃ©n tengo un servidor de [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kzwy5FH) que nada tiene que ver con lo que hago y un hermoso [Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/0hJlPgmcwCMAfgCTiownb2?si=jeZzbTlGTvy_jf2MqJAfaA)
Que ninguno tiene algo que ver, pero son cosas que me hacen feliz.
